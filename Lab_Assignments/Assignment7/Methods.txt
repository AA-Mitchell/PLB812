Ran the standard FastQC workflow. Saw some pretty low quality reads, though no adapter sequences.
Cleaned up the reads with cutadapt and fed the results directly into FastQC again. Results looked much nicer. (quality threshold set to 20)

used bwa mem to generate the bwa alignment index using the A.thaliana genome v11 from phytozome. This took many hours to run.

converted the bwa output to a sorted .bam file using samtools sort. Fed this directly into samtools flagstat with output option set to tsv.
Renamed the slurmount results file.
