Methods:

SRA files: 

After locating the appropriate accession files in NCBI (SRR5448235 SRR5448234 SRR5448232 SRR5448233 SRR5448230 SRR5448231 SRR5448229 SRR5448228 
SRR5448226 SRR5448227 SRR5448225 SRR5448223 SRR5448224) I used the prefetch command to download all SRR files into their self-named
directories. From there, I made two new directories "Solanum/RNA_Seq" and moved all into 'RNA_Seq/' before using the fastq-dump command and gzip/split-3
options to convert the .sra files to .fastq.gz format. I initially tried doing this all in a single loop as shown in the lecture slides, but
I couldn't get it to perform and ended up executing each step individually.

Genomic files: 

I found the v.6 Solanum tuberosum genome data on Phytozome and downloaded all zipped files to a folder on my PC. From there I navigated to the download location (Desktop) within a local unix terminal before logging into the sftp tool. After logging in I used the 'put' command to transfer the files into the home directory on the hpcc cluster terminal. Within the hpcc terminal I then unzipped all files using the "gzip" command and decompress "--d" option. I could have done all of this at once, but again decided to do it one file at a time instead (still getting used to all this).
