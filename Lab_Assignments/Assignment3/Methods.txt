Methods: Not accurate, opened .html files and they were blank!! Will update when resolved


For this one I used a list and a "For" loop that initially defined all the .fastq files to be trimmed/run through fastqc. I then referenced this list within
the input line of cutadapt. It was important to include the --interleaved option as my data is paired-end. This took some reading to solve.

Anyway, I used the mv command to send all trimmed fastq files from cutadapt to a seperate directory "trimmed_fastq_files" 
I then had fastqc run all files within this newly created directory and output the resultant .html files to another directory "trimmed_fastqc_files"

I used 'cp' to copy these .html files to my github repository under Assignment3 and pushed them to github

I want to mention that my initial .fastq files looked really nice to begin with, showing no adapter sequences and a constant read length of 100bp.
I guess these may have already been run through a QC protocol? Anyway, my fastqc .html files look identical (more or less) before and afer running cutadapt, 
even after plating around with some of the parameters.
