Started by downloading the annotation file from phytozome. Used this to generate the topGO.tsv file needed for enrichment testing with 'readMappings'

Had to make a table of dds results which contrasted t0 and t10 conditions before proceeding to topGO

created the upGenes object, setting logfold2 change to >= 1 (same thing for down genes though with sign reversed)

fed the Genes list into topGO for BP,CC, and MF. Repeated this for downGenes as well.
*should note that my up/down geneslists returned identical GO terms for each run, though the individual terms are different. I suspect something is amiss with this, but
I'm unsure what.

Exported these tables as .tsv files.

Had to correct my initial genes list to correct for mismatches in naming between it and my Goterms.
