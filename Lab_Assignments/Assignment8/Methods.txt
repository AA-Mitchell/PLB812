Used picard MarkDuplicates and AddOrReplaceReadGroups commands to generate the required files for gatk. This was quick and painless. 

**Arguments for Add/Replace: RGID=1 RGLB=lib1 RGPL=ILLUMIA RGPU=NA RGSM=WS2

The tricky part of this lab one was discovering that gatk needed index files for both the reference fasta and the sorted.bam inputs. 
  I ended up making these with the samtools index and faidx commands. Not complicated once I identified the problem gatk was having
  
**Arguments for gatk: -ERC GVCF
  
  I then fed gatk the proper input files with the index files in place and let it do it's thing. Pretty straightforward. 
  Had to alter my .sh file such that the gatk env was referenced.
